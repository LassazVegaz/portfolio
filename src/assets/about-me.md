Hi there, my name is Lasindu Nuwanga Weerasinghe and I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with four years of experience. My expertise lies in building **Web, Desktop, and Mobile Applications**. If you are looking for my services, feel free to check out my **Fiverr** account where I have completed around 25 projects with positive reviews from satisfied clients. For more information on my work experience, you can also check out my previous employers here.

When it comes to web development, I specialize in using Fullstack frameworks such as **.NET Blazor** or **NextJS**. If the frontend and backend need to be separated, I use **React** or **Angular** for the frontend and **.NET API** or **NestJS** for the backend. For desktop applications, I use **Electron**. If the application is for Windows only, I use **.NET WinForms** or **WPF**. Additionally, I develop Mobile Apps, Web Apps, and Desktop Apps using **.NET MAUI** or **Flutter** in a single codebase.

If you are interested in learning more about my work or my journey as a developer, feel free to read my story here. Thank you for your time!
